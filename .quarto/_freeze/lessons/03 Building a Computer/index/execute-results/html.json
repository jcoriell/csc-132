Specific to Python, you have used lists (similar to arrays) in your\nprograms. In this lesson, we will discuss some powerful functions that work with lists and introduce\nseveral new data structures.\n\n## Useful List Functions\n\nAs you have seen, Python lists are extremely useful data structures. In the first Python lesson, you were\nintroduced to several list functions that, for example, reverse a list, sort a list, etc. In this lesson, we will\ncover several more powerful built-in functions that are quite useful when used with lists.\nThe filter function returns an iterator that contains a new list consisting of only the items within an\nexisting list for which some user-defined function is true. The user-defined function can be anything\nthat evaluates an input in the existing list and returns true or false. The format for the filter function\nis as follows:\n\n```Python3\nfilter(function, mylist)\n```\n\n",
